# Advent of Code 2022 - Wheel Edition

AoC but using a wheel to pick a random language (mostly obscure or outdated) to solve each day with, unless it depends on a previous day.

Languages were chosen based solely on whether I've personally used them or not, so if an obvious language is missing you think should be on here (PowerShell, ASM...) then I've likely used it at least once before.
